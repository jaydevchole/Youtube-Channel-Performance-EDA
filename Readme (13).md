#  Unlocking YouTube Channel Performance Secrets

##  Project Overview
This project dives deep into YouTube channel analytics to uncover the hidden drivers of video performance, audience engagement, and revenue generation. Using real-world data and machine learning techniques, we explore how factors like video duration, upload timing, and viewer behavior influence monetization and subscriber growth.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on YouTube video metrics
- Engineer features to quantify engagement and revenue efficiency
- Visualize performance trends and correlations
- Build a predictive model to estimate revenue based on engagement metrics
- Derive actionable insights to optimize content strategy

##  Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Python (Pandas, NumPy) | Data manipulation |
| Matplotlib, Seaborn | Visualization |
| Scikit-learn | Machine learning |
| Jupyter Notebook / VS Code | Development environment |

##  Dataset Description
The dataset includes 364 videos and 70+ features such as:
- **Video Details**: Duration, publish time, day of week
- **Engagement Metrics**: Views, likes, shares, comments, CTR
- **Audience Data**: New/returning viewers, subscribers, unsubscribes
- **Revenue Metrics**: AdSense, DoubleClick, YouTube Premium, CPM

##  Workflow Summary
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert durations
2. **EDA**: heatmaps, top revenue videos
3. **Feature Engineering**: Revenue per view, engagement rate
4. **Visualization**: Revenue distribution, scatter plots
5. **Modeling**: Random Forest Regressor to predict revenue
6. **Evaluation**: MSE, RÂ² score, feature importance

##  Sample Insights
- Engagement rate and views are strong predictors of revenue
- Videos published on certain days show higher monetization
- High CTR correlates with better audience retention
